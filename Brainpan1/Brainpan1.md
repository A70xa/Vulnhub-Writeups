# Brainpan1 - Writeup

Brainpan1 is an intermediate-level machine from Vulnhub by superkojiman.<br />
This is a Buffer Overflow machine, so you need to have basic knowledge of scripting and buffer overflow.<br />

## Target discovery

Starting with identifying our target IP address.

```
sudo netdiscover -i vboxnet0 -r 10.10.10.0/24

Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

2 Captured ARP Req/Rep packets, from 2 hosts.   Total size: 84

<br />

## Scanning The Target

Scanning the target for open ports and running services.

<br />
<br />

We have two open ports, let's start our enumeration.
<br />

## Enumeration

Fire `nikto` and `gobuster` in the background while we manually examine these two ports.

![](Pics/web.png)
<br />
<br />

It's an application that expects inputs, let's connect to it via netcat.

![](Pics/app.png)
<br />
<br />

We crash it, I guess!<br />
Anyway, let's examine port `10000`.

![](Pics/web2.png)
<br />
<br />

Just an image about safe coding. Back at our results.

![](Pics/results.png)
<br />
<br />

We have a `/bin` directory. Let's browse it.

![](Pics/web3.png)
<br />
<br />

Well, it's a windows executables `.exe` file, am going to download it on a windows VM and execute it.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

This machine is about `Buffer Overflow`, we need a debugger, I'll use Immunity debugger.<br />
[https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/](https://www.immunityinc.com/products/debugger/)
<br />
<br />
Now, Buffer Overflow occurs when a program or process attempts to write more data than the bufferâ€™s capacity, resulting in adjacent memory being overwritten, which gives the attacker full control over the program execution.

To Perform Buffer Overflow, follow these steps:
- Fuzzing: Is it vulnerable? and how many bytes would crash the application?
- Finding the Offset: Which bytes locate in EIP?
- Overwriting The EIP: Control the execution.
- Generating shellcode.
- Getting shell.

## Fuzzing

On Windows, start the application `Brainpan.exe`.

![](Pics/app2.png)
<br />
<br />

Open Immunity and click on `ctrl+F1` to attach the service (brainpan.exe) to Immunity.

![](Pics/dbg.png)
<br />
<br />

Notice that the application is in `Pause`, Click on `F9` to run it.

![](Pics/dbg2.png)
<br />
<br />

Let's write a python script that connects to the application, sends 100 `A` to the application, keeps increasing by 100 on each attempt until it crashes, then prints the length of bytes that crash the application.<br />
My windows machine is at `10.10.10.9`.

![](Pics/exp.png)
<br />
<br />

Make it executable and run it.

![](Pics/exp2.png)
<br />
<br />

The application crashed at 700 bytes.<br />
On Immunity, we got an error message saying that the EIP address had changed to `41414141` which is the hex of `AAAA`.

![](Pics/dbg3.png)
<br />
<br />

## Finding The Offset

Now, find the exact 4 bytes locate in EIP, we'll use a tool called `msf-pattern_create` with argument `-l` for the length of the pattern.

![](Pics/offset.png)
<br />
<br />

Paste the pattern into the script.

![](Pics/exp3.png)
<br />
<br />

PS: Remember to restart the program every time it crashes by clicking on `ctrl+F2`, then `F9` to run it.<br />
Run the script and navigate to Immunity.

![](Pics/dbg4.png)
<br />
<br />

Copy EIP's address `35724134`, and use `msf-pattern_offset -q 35724134 -l 700` to locate the exact bytes.

![](Pics/offset2.png)
<br />
<br />

## Overwrite The EIP

Now, modify our script.

![](Pics/exp4.png)
<br />
<br />

Our script will connect to the server, Overflow the buffer with `524 A`, and Overwrite the EIP with `4 B`.<br />
Restart the server, run the script, and back to Immunity.

![](Pics/dbg5.png)
<br />
<br />

The EIP address has changed to `42424242` which means BBBB.<br />
We control EIP! I mean, if we inject EIP with an address that store a shellcode, it will be executed.
<br />

Let's find bad Characters.<br />
Bad Characters is a reserved character for the application, we can't use them.

```
"\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f\x10\x11\x12\x13\x14\x15\x16\x17\x18\x19\x1a\x1b\x1c\x1d\x1e\x1f\x20"
"\x21\x22\x23\x24\x25\x26\x27\x28\x29\x2a\x2b\x2c\x2d\x2e\x2f\x30\x31\x32\x33\x34\x35\x36\x37\x38\x39\x3a\x3b\x3c\x3d\x3e\x3f\x40"
"\x41\x42\x43\x44\x45\x46\x47\x48\x49\x4a\x4b\x4c\x4d\x4e\x4f\x50\x51\x52\x53\x54\x55\x56\x57\x58\x59\x5a\x5b\x5c\x5d\x5e\x5f\x60"
"\x61\x62\x63\x64\x65\x66\x67\x68\x69\x6a\x6b\x6c\x6d\x6e\x6f\x70\x71\x72\x73\x74\x75\x76\x77\x78\x79\x7a\x7b\x7c\x7d\x7e\x7f\x80"
"\x81\x82\x83\x84\x85\x86\x87\x88\x89\x8a\x8b\x8c\x8d\x8e\x8f\x90\x91\x92\x93\x94\x95\x96\x97\x98\x99\x9a\x9b\x9c\x9d\x9e\x9f\xa0"
"\xa1\xa2\xa3\xa4\xa5\xa6\xa7\xa8\xa9\xaa\xab\xac\xad\xae\xaf\xb0\xb1\xb2\xb3\xb4\xb5\xb6\xb7\xb8\xb9\xba\xbb\xbc\xbd\xbe\xbf\xc0"
"\xc1\xc2\xc3\xc4\xc5\xc6\xc7\xc8\xc9\xca\xcb\xcc\xcd\xce\xcf\xd0\xd1\xd2\xd3\xd4\xd5\xd6\xd7\xd8\xd9\xda\xdb\xdc\xdd\xde\xdf\xe0"
"\xe1\xe2\xe3\xe4\xe5\xe6\xe7\xe8\xe9\xea\xeb\xec\xed\xee\xef\xf0\xf1\xf2\xf3\xf4\xf5\xf6\xf7\xf8\xf9\xfa\xfb\xfc\xfd\xfe\xff"
```
<br />

Modify our script.

![](Pics/exp5.png)
<br />
<br />

Run the script, head back to Immunity and click on `ESP` then right-click and `Follow in Dump`.

![](Pics/dbg6.png)
<br />
<br />

Searching for any missing characters.<br />
Except the null byte "\x00", we have no bad characters.

![](Pics/dbg7.png)
<br />
<br />

Finally, looking for a jump statement with no memory protection.<br />
We will use mona.py module (not installed by default). Run `!mona modules` down at the bottom.

![](Pics/dbg8.png)
<br />
<br />

Great! We'll use brainpan.exe, enter `!mona find -s '\xff\xe4' -m brainpan.exe`.

![](Pics/dbg9.png)
<br />
<br />

Note this address `0x311712f3`, We'll inject EIP with this address which will jump to our shellcode.<br />
<br />

## Getting access

Now, generate windows reverse shell.

![](Pics/shell.png)
<br />
<br />

Copy it to our script.

![](Pics/exp6.png)
<br />
<br />

Test time. Close `Immunity` and relaunch Brainpan.exe.

![](Pics/app3.png)
<br />
<br />

Launch a listener, and run our script.

![](Pics/shell2.png)
<br />
<br />

Great! We successfully perform buffer overflow on the Windows machine.<br />
Now, generate a Linux payload to exploit the actual application.

![](Pics/venom.png)
<br />
<br />

Modify our script with the new payload.<br />
Remember to add `NOPs` which means `No Operation (\x90)`.

![](Pics/exp7.png)
<br />
<br />

Launch a listener and run the script.

![](Pics/shell3.png)
<br />
<br />

## Privilege Escalation

When we check sudo permission, there is one binary we can run as sudo.

![](Pics/shell4.png)
<br />
<br />

We can use sudo with `anansi_util`.<br />
Run `anansi_util`, and we have three options, "manual" looks interesting, searching at GTFObins, we can use `manual` to get root. [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/man/](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/man/).

![](Pics/shell5.png)
<br />
<br />

Enter `!/bin/bash`.

![](Pics/shell6.png)
<br />

Cat our flag.
