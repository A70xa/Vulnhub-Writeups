# HMS-Writeup 
HMS is an easy machine from Vulnhub by Nivek.<br />
I've tested this machine on VirtualBox.<br />
Link to the machine: [https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hms-1,728/](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/hms-1,728/).
<br />

## Identify the target
I'm using the machine in host-only network. Here, I am using netdiscover to detect the IP address of the target.
```
netdiscover -i vboxnet0 -r 10.10.10.0/24

Currently scanning: Finished!   |   Screen View: Unique Hosts

<br />

## Scan Open Ports

We have to look for open ports on the target.
```
nmap -sV -sC -p- -oN nmap.log 10.10.10.10

21/tcp   open  ftp     vsftpd 3.0.3

<br />

We can access the FTP service anonymously.
```

<br />

There is nothing in there.

## Examine Port 7080 - Apache

![](pics/login.png)
<br />

We have a login page, but no registeration link, and we donâ€™t have any credentials.<br />
Let's use `Burp` to intercept the request.<br />
Send it to repeater, modified email with `'`.

![](pics/burp1.png)
<br />

The field email in this form suffers from an SQL injection. 
```
' or 1=1 #
' or 1=1 -- 
```
<br />

You can also use developer tools to modify the request.<br />
However, there is a validation in the input field that it must be an `email`. Thus we have to remove it to inject our payload. So, inspect the email field and remove `type="email"`.
<br />
And we have access to the admin panel.

![](pics/admin1.png)
<br />

After we login, we see a directory for uploaded images in the source.

![](pics/source1.png)
<br />

And a path for the settings that are commented.

![](pics/source2.png)
<br />

When we visit `setting.php`, we see an image uploading feature.

![](pics/admin2.png)
<br />

## Reverse Shell

Let's upload a shell. There is a web shells in kali by default: `ls /usr/share/webshells`, Or you can find one online: [revshells](https://www.revshells.com/),  [pentestmonkey](https://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)<br />

I Changed the IP address and port, and started listening on the same port.
```
nc -lnvp 5555
```
<br />

We have a dummy shell, let's upgrade it.

![](pics/shell1.png)
<br />

There are two users on the machine `eren` and `nivek`. We need to switch to a real user so let us check the SUID binaries.

![](pics/perm.png)
<br />

> Reference: [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/bash/#suid)
<br />

So, we can use it to get an instance of bash shell as user `eren`.
```
/usr/bin/bash -p
```
<br />

We still user `daemon` but `eren` is the effective user for this process only, this means that we don't have access to sudo permissions.

![](pics/euid.png)
<br />

After a while of digging around, I checked the cron jobs, and there is a backup script in the eren's directory. 

![](pics/cron.png)
<br />

This script runs every 5 minutes and is owned by `eren`. we can modify it to get another reverse shell as user `eren` on port `1234`.

![](pics/nano.png)
<br />

In five minutes I got a shell with user eren.

![](pics/rshell1.png)
<br />

## Privilege Escalation

Let's check the sudo permission:
```
sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for eren on nivek:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin

User eren may run the following commands on nivek:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /bin/tar
```
<br />

> Searching in gtfobins: [https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/#sudo)
<br />

tar gives us a root shell
```
sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/bash
```
<br />

and we're root.
